      <h3>Communitea</h3>
	  <a href="https://jrepusseau.github.io/Communitea/index.html" target="_blank">
	<p> BETA <p>
</a>
      <p>Communitea wants to improve nudges in order to reduce plastic waste. The main idea is to reward people for bringing their own containers and bags when buying items such as coffee, groceries, or pizza. 
Everytime stores notice customers bringing their own containers or bags, they will give them Communitea stickers with their own logo.  On the stickers will be qr codes which will scan and accumulate reward points. Once a certain amount of points is reached, Communitea in partnership with the store will offer discount items or free items.
All the stickers are unique according to the store or restaurant and when the sticker is scanned you get points, after a certain amounts of points you will have the ability to level up in the Communitea.  
We put the store on the Communitea map as à form of exposure advertisement amongst users. The number of people received stickers at that specific shop will be displayed on the map. Also, limited edition stickers can be designed and made in collaboration with influential artists for marketing purposes.
